This repository contains a basic implementation of a bigram language model using PyTorch. The model is trained on the text data provided in input.txt to predict the next character in a sequence.

Key Features
Transformer Architecture: The model utilizes the Transformer architecture, known for its effectiveness in natural language processing tasks.
PyTorch Framework: Implemented using PyTorch, a popular deep learning library for flexibility and ease of use.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Several hyperparameters are exposed in the code for easy experimentation and customization.
Usage
Clone the repository:

Prepare data:

Place your text data in a file named input.txt within the repository directory.
The code assumes UTF-8 encoding for the input text.
Run the model:

Bash
python model.py
Wees voorzichtig met code.
content_copy
The model will train on the text data and periodically print training and validation losses.
After training, the model will generate a sample text based on the learned patterns.
Code Structure
model.py:  Contains the core PyTorch code for:

Data preparation (encoding/decoding text, splitting data into training and validation sets).
Model architecture (embedding layers, Transformer blocks, linear head).
Training loop (loss calculation, optimization).
Text generation.
input.txt: This is where you should place your text data.

notebook.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook providing a more detailed walkthrough of the model's implementation, including explanations and experimentation steps.

Customization
You can adjust the model's behavior by modifying the following hyperparameters in the code:

batch_size: Number of sequences processed in parallel during training.
block_size: Maximum context length for predictions.
max_iters: Total number of training iterations.
eval_interval: Interval at which to evaluate and print losses.
learning_rate: Learning rate for the optimizer.
n_embd: Embedding dimension.
n_head: Number of attention heads in each Transformer block.
n_layer: Number of Transformer blocks.
dropout: Dropout probability.
Additional Notes
This is a simplified language model primarily for educational purposes. For more sophisticated models, consider using pre-trained language models or exploring other architectures.
The notebook.ipynb file provides additional insights into the model and can be a valuable resource for learning and experimentation.
